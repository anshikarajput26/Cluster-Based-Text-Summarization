Everything we are surrounded by, the trees, water, air, grass, furniture in our house, makes up the environment. The environment makes it possible for us to live on earth, and it keeps a strict balance between the elements present on earth. However, lately, the balance has been disrupted. Natural resources are diminishing,mainly due to the misuse and greed of human beings. One of the basic requirements of the earth is keeping the environment clean. Not only are we failing to maintain that, but the environment’s condition is also becoming worse day by day. The pollution caused by human beings has an adverse effect on the environment, and pollution harms the environment and affects us. Specific measures need to be taken to curb the toxicity caused to the environment. Plastics and papers need to be recycled and reused, and more trees should be planted for purifying the air.People should carpool together instead of travelling in private cars. A fine should be issued for people who litter the streets with garbage.If these measures are not taken, the earth will gradually become unfit for living. A clean and proper environment is needed for all living creatures’ existence.With the increase of environmental depletion, the government has also started taking things seriously. However, it is not enough; without the people’s co-operation, nature will continue on its path of degradation, and someday we will be wiped from existence.
